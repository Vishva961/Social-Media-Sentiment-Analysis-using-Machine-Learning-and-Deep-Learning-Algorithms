# Social Media Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in social media data. Using both **Machine Learning algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and a **Deep Learning model (LSTM)**, the project classifies user reviews into positive and negative sentiments.  

The goal is to compare the performance of classical ML models with deep learning techniques in handling textual data.
